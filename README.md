Likert-Diverging-Stacked-Bar-Chart
----------------------------------

Still working on this - a function to build diverging stacked-bar charts in R for use in presenting Likert-scale data.

Things I would like this to do:

- Allow for entry of data labels to replace generic column labels (e.g. 'q1' retitled to 'How effective was this script?')
- Accept familiar color syntax
